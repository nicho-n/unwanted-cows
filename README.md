U+2800 is a more exciting version of the whitespace character, bypassing the filtering done by most websites. 

A non-technical way of describing the effect is with [a classic Buddhist metaphor from Thich Naht Hahn](https://www.lionsroar.com/heart-sutra-fullness-emptiness/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaY2u3C6dgAIRaX6s6XqgIbdcel4NCBbCEi8rUCKP1lojyvXs4MXPmXh9-o_aem_p3-7qujV6kJvEgaTiBX0Qg):

- "If I am holding a cup of water and I ask you, “Is this cup empty?” you will say, “No, it is full of water.” But if I pour out the water and ask you again, you may say, “Yes, it is empty.” But empty of what? Empty means empty of something. The cup cannot be empty of nothing. “Empty” doesn’t mean anything unless you know “empty of what?” My cup is empty of water, but it is not empty of air."
