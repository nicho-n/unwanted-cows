
This is a simple script which replaces the whitespace character (spacebar) with [U+2800](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2800), enabling the insertion of cows in unusual places.

U+2800 is a more exciting version of the whitespace character, bypassing the filtering done by most websites. 

You can insert [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) in a textbox that's just expecting normal text this way.  

It's inspired by ["Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form"](https://www.lionsroar.com/heart-sutra-fullness-emptiness/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaY2u3C6dgAIRaX6s6XqgIbdcel4NCBbCEi8rUCKP1lojyvXs4MXPmXh9-o_aem_p3-7qujV6kJvEgaTiBX0Qg), a concept described by Thich Nhat Hanh.

"If I am holding a cup of water and I ask you, “Is this cup empty?” you will say, “No, it is full of water.” But if I pour out the water and ask you again, you may say, “Yes, it is empty.” But empty of what? Empty means empty of something. The cup cannot be empty of nothing. “Empty” doesn’t mean anything unless you know “empty of what?” My cup is empty of water, but it is not empty of air. To be empty is to be empty of something. This is quite a discovery."

Below, a crudely-drawn cow is my instagram decription.
